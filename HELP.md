# Bank-of-Saxby - Help

This Sofware is written in Java and is distributed as `.jar` files. These `jars` are completely stand-alone and contain all external dependencies.

The latest release can be downloaded from [this page](https://github.com/saxbophone/Bank-of-Saxby/releases). Your computer will probably display a warning message about this file. **This is expected** (as it is an executable program). I promise that I have not written any deliberately malicious code (as the source code is freely available, anyone can verify this) and that it is most likely fine to run this software. **However there is no warranty whatsoever and I wash my hands of any problems that might be caused by the software (even though such occurences are extremely unlikely).**

> More information on the lack of warranty can be found in [the appropriate section of the License](https://github.com/saxbophone/Bank-of-Saxby/blob/master/LICENSE#L258).

To run the software you will need **Java** installed on your computer. It's most likely that you already have this, although if you don't for whatever reason then you can install that [from the official website](https://java.com/en/download/).

Providing that you have Java installed you should just be able to double-click the `.jar` file you downloaded to run the software.
